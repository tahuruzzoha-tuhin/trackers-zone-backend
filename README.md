### About Project 
   - This site is about a Tour Package Booking System. We take all the responsibilities of our tourists and take order from this site. It's a task of assignment 11 given by programming hero. I have kept client side code in another repo and this is how I manage that sites server side.


#### Technolgy I've Used: 
- I created some api's here to fetch data from database
- I used mongodb as database
- express is used here to make the task easier.
- I also have used cors to ignore warning
- I placed my database info in a env file and that's how I kept it secret
